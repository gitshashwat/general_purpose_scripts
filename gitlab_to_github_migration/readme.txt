Step1:

0) Clone this repo

1) Create all repos (empty) and (private) from gitlab to github.

To do so:
* Generate access tokens for gitlab and github and add them to the script create_empty_repos.py [this gets you direct projects, projects in group (level one and level two)

Post this step, all repos should be created. This script will generate a text file with all the http url links of the gitlab account you have to migrate.

2) Run scripts.py and wait.
